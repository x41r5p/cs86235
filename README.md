程序ccurs. Provide an example to support your answer. (4pts) <br>CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS<br>1.   Choose 3 different transcripts, each representing a different developmental stage for Sarah. In these transcripts, examine the types of questions that Sarah’s mother directs towards Sarah at younger versus older ages.For each transcript, identify Sarah’s age and describe the patterns of questioning you observe at that stage. How are the changes in question types related to the changes in child-directed speech as discussed in class? Discuss how these shifts reflect key stages of language development and cognition. Relate your response to specific concepts discussed in class and justify your points with examples from the transcripts.In your response, include the specific transcripts you used and highlight the types of questions asked (e.g., yes/no questions). (13pts)2.   Compare Sarah’s Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) over the course of language development to her mother’s MLU across the same time span. What significant changes do you notice in both Sarah’s and her mother’s MLUs? How do these changes relate to key milestones in language development? Consider factors such as sentence complexity, vocabulary expansion, and syntactic variation in your response. How do these changes reflect the interaction between Sarah’s developing linguistic abilities and her mother's input? Provide detailed examples from the transcripts to support your analysis.
